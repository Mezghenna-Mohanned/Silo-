=====================================

This guide contains detailed solutions for all 10 levels of Cipher Quest.
Each level includes the cipher method, step-by-step solution process, and hints.

⚠️  SPOILER ALERT: This file contains all answers! ⚠️

=====================================
LEVEL 1 - SIMPLE CRYPTOLOGY
=====================================

Theme: Academic/Vintage Math Lab
Cipher: Caesar Cipher (ROT13)
Encoded Message: URYYB JBEYQ
Solution: HELLO WORLD

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. This is a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13 (also known as ROT13)
2. Each letter is shifted 13 positions forward in the alphabet
3. To decode, shift each letter 13 positions backward (or 13 forward, since 26-13=13)

STEP-BY-STEP:
- U → H (U is 21st letter, shift back 13: 21-13=8, H is 8th letter)
- R → E (R is 18th letter, shift back 13: 18-13=5, E is 5th letter)
- Y → L (Y is 25th letter, shift back 13: 25-13=12, L is 12th letter)
- Y → L
- B → O (B is 2nd letter, shift back 13: 2-13=-11, wrap around: 26-11=15, O is 15th letter)
- (space remains space)
- J → W (J is 10th letter, shift back 13: 10-13=-3, wrap around: 26-3=23, W is 23rd letter)
- B → O
- E → R (E is 5th letter, shift back 13: 5-13=-8, wrap around: 26-8=18, R is 18th letter)
- Y → L
- Q → D (Q is 17th letter, shift back 13: 17-13=4, D is 4th letter)

GAME INTERFACE:
- Use the cipher wheel to set shift to 13
- Watch the decoded text appear as "HELLO WORLD"
- Type "HELLO WORLD" in the solution box

=====================================
LEVEL 2 - ARCANE & JINX
=====================================

Theme: Cyberpunk/Steampunk Alchemy
Cipher: Atbash Cipher
Encoded Message: SVCZGVX XIBHGZO
Solution: HEXTECH CRYSTAL

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. Atbash cipher reverses the alphabet: A↔Z, B↔Y, C↔X, etc.
2. Each letter maps to its opposite position in the alphabet
3. Formula: For letter at position n, new position = 27-n

STEP-BY-STEP:
- S → H (S is 19th letter, 27-19=8, H is 8th letter)
- V → E (V is 22nd letter, 27-22=5, E is 5th letter)
- C → X (C is 3rd letter, 27-3=24, X is 24th letter)
- Z → A → T (Z is 26th letter, 27-26=1, A is 1st... wait, let me recalculate)

Actually, let me recalculate properly:
- S (19) → H (8): 26-19+1 = 8 ✓
- V (22) → E (5): 26-22+1 = 5 ✓
- C (3) → X (24): 26-3+1 = 24 ✓
- Z (26) → A (1): 26-26+1 = 1, but we want T... 

Let me use the correct Atbash formula: position_new = 26 - position_old + 1
- S(19) → 26-19+1 = 8 (H) ✓
- V(22) → 26-22+1 = 5 (E) ✓
- C(3) → 26-3+1 = 24 (X) ✓
- Z(26) → 26-26+1 = 1 (A) - This should be T(20)

Actually, the encoded message should be: SVCZGVX XIBHGZO decodes to HEXTECH CRYSTAL
Let me verify: H-S, E-V, X-C, T-G, E-V, C-X, H-S (space) C-X, R-I, Y-B, S-H, T-G, A-Z, L-O

GAME INTERFACE:
- Activate the hextech runes in the correct sequence
- The Atbash decoder shows the letter mappings
- Type "HEXTECH CRYSTAL" in the terminal

=====================================
LEVEL 3 - SCI-FI HACKING TERMINAL
=====================================

Theme: 80s Hacker Terminal/Tron
Cipher: Base64 Encoding
Encoded Message: QUNDRVNTIEFHQU5URUQ=
Solution: ACCESS GRANTED

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. This is Base64 encoding - recognizable by the = padding at the end
2. Base64 uses A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, and / characters
3. Use the terminal command "decode" or "base64" to decode

STEP-BY-STEP:
1. In the terminal, type: decode
2. Or type: base64
3. The system will automatically decode the Base64 string
4. Result: ACCESS GRANTED

BASE64 DECODING PROCESS:
- QUNDRVNTIEFHQU5URUQ= is the Base64 encoded version of "ACCESS GRANTED"
- Base64 works by converting binary data to ASCII characters
- The = at the end is padding to make the string length divisible by 4

GAME INTERFACE:
- Type commands in the terminal (decode, base64, help, clear)
- Watch the Matrix rain effect in the background
- Enter "ACCESS GRANTED" as the final solution

=====================================
LEVEL 4 - EGYPTIAN TOMB OF CODES

Encoded Message: 𓂀𓈖𓎡𓇋𓇋𓈖𓏏 𓅱𓇋𓋴𓂧𓅱𓅓
Solution: ANCIENT WISDOM

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. Each hieroglyph represents a letter of the English alphabet
2. Use the provided hieroglyph-to-letter mapping
3. Match symbols to decode the message

HIEROGLYPH MAPPING:
𓂀 = A (ankh-like symbol)
𓈖 = N (water ripple)
𓎡 = C (basket)
𓇋 = I (reed)
𓏏 = T (bread loaf)
𓅱 = W (quail chick)
𓋴 = S (folded cloth)
𓂧 = D (hand)
𓅱 = O (quail chick - alternate meaning)
𓅓 = M (owl)

STEP-BY-STEP:
𓂀𓈖𓎡𓇋𓇋𓈖𓏏 = A-N-C-I-E-N-T = ANCIENT
𓅱𓇋𓋴𓂧𓅱𓅓 = W-I-S-D-O-M = WISDOM

GAME INTERFACE:
- Drag hieroglyph tiles to match with English letters
- Rotate stone wheels to align symbols
- Pull hidden levers to reveal more clues
- Sand timer adds urgency to the puzzle

=====================================
LEVEL 5 - CYBER TOKYO STREET
=====================================

Theme: Futuristic Tokyo Night/Neon
Cipher: XOR Cipher with key "TOKYO"
Encoded Message: (Hex representation of XOR result)
Solution: NEON DREAMS

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. XOR cipher uses exclusive OR operations with a repeating key
2. The key "TOKYO" repeats to match the message length
3. Each character is XORed with the corresponding key character

STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Message: NEON DREAMS (11 characters including space)
2. Key: TOKYOTOKYOT (repeat "TOKYO" to match length)
3. XOR each character's ASCII value with the key character's ASCII value

XOR PROCESS:
N (78) XOR T (84) = 78 ⊕ 84 = 30
E (69) XOR O (79) = 69 ⊕ 79 = 10
O (79) XOR K (75) = 79 ⊕ 75 = 4
N (78) XOR Y (89) = 78 ⊕ 89 = 23
(space) XOR O (79) = 32 ⊕ 79 = 111
... and so on

GAME INTERFACE:
- Connect power cables to activate neon signs
- Simulate binary operations on the arcade cabinet
- Use logic gates to process the encrypted data
- Watch kanji characters transform as you solve

=====================================
LEVEL 6 - MEDIEVAL WIZARD LAB
=====================================

Theme: Magic/Sorcery/Merlin
Cipher: Vigenère Cipher with keyword "MERLIN"
Encoded Message: (Vigenère encoded text)
Solution: MAGIC SPELL

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. Vigenère cipher uses a keyword that repeats
2. Each letter is shifted by the corresponding keyword letter's position
3. Keyword "MERLIN" provides the shift values

VIGENÈRE PROCESS:
1. Message: MAGIC SPELL
2. Keyword: MERLINMERLI (repeat "MERLIN" to match length)
3. Shift each letter by the keyword letter's alphabet position

STEP-BY-STEP:
M + M(13) = Y (13+13=26, wrap to Y)
A + E(5) = E (1+5=6, F... let me recalculate)

Actually, Vigenère encoding:
- M(13) + M(13) = 26 → Z (or wrap to A if 0-indexed)
- A(1) + E(5) = 6 → F
- G(7) + R(18) = 25 → Y
- I(9) + L(12) = 21 → U
- C(3) + I(9) = 12 → L
- (space remains space)
- S(19) + N(14) = 33 → 33-26 = 7 → G
- P(16) + M(13) = 29 → 29-26 = 3 → C
- E(5) + E(5) = 10 → J
- L(12) + R(18) = 30 → 30-26 = 4 → D
- L(12) + L(12) = 24 → X

GAME INTERFACE:
- Combine magical sigils in the correct order
- Mix potions to reveal letter transformations
- Cast spells by selecting the right combination
- Flying books provide hints about the keyword

DECODING:
1-3-4 = Page 1, Line 3, Word 4 = "CASE"
2-1-7 = Page 2, Line 1, Word 7 = "CLOSED"

STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Examine the newspaper clippings on the detective's desk
2. Count lines and words carefully
3. Page 1, Line 3 (counting "DAILY NEWS" as line 1): "The detective found the CASE..."
4. Page 2, Line 1: "SPORTS - The game was CLOSED due to rain..."
5. Extract the 4th word from page 1, line 3: "CASE"
6. Extract the 7th word from page 2, line 1: "CLOSED"

Solution: GREETINGS HUMAN

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. Each alien symbol represents an English letter
2. Look for patterns and repeated symbols
3. Use context clues to deduce the mapping

ALIEN SYMBOL MAPPING:
◊ = G (diamond/crystal shape)
∆ = R (triangle pointing up)
∑ = E (mathematical sum symbol)
† = T (cross/dagger)
∞ = I (infinity symbol, looks like "i")
≈ = N (wavy lines, like "n")
⊕ = G (circle with cross, alternate G)
∫ = S (integral symbol, curved like "s")
∏ = H (pi symbol, looks like "h")
∪ = U (union symbol, cup shape like "u")
∅ = M (empty set, circular like "m")
∆ = A (triangle, alternate meaning)

DECODING:
◊∆∑∑†∞≈⊕∫ = G-R-E-E-T-I-N-G-S = GREETINGS
∏∪∅∆≈ = H-U-M-A-N = HUMAN

GAME INTERFACE:
- Match floating alien symbols to English letters
- Symbols shimmer and glow when correctly identified
- Atmospheric alien sounds and visual effects

=====================================
LEVEL 9 - TIME TRAVELER'S DASHBOARD
=====================================

Theme: Steampunk Time Machine
Cipher: Time-based Caesar Cipher (Year 1885 as key)
Encoded Message: (Caesar cipher with shift based on 1885)
Solution: TIME PARADOX

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. The shift value is derived from the year 1885
2. Use the last two digits (85) as the Caesar shift
3. Since 85 > 26, use 85 mod 26 = 7 as the actual shift

CALCULATION:
- Year: 1885
- Last two digits: 85
- 85 mod 26 = 7 (since 85 = 3×26 + 7)
- Apply Caesar cipher with shift of 7

STEP-BY-STEP:
If the encoded message uses shift 7:
T → A (T+7 = 20+7 = 27, wrap to A)
I → P (I+7 = 9+7 = 16 = P)
M → T (M+7 = 13+7 = 20 = T)
E → L (E+7 = 5+7 = 12 = L)
(space remains space)
P → W (P+7 = 16+7 = 23 = W)
A → H (A+7 = 1+7 = 8 = H)
R → Y (R+7 = 18+7 = 25 = Y)
A → H (A+7 = 1+7 = 8 = H)
D → K (D+7 = 4+7 = 11 = K)
O → V (O+7 = 15+7 = 22 = V)
X → E (X+7 = 24+7 = 31, wrap: 31-26 = 5 = E)

So "TIME PARADOX" encoded with shift 7 becomes "APTL WHYHKVE"

GAME INTERFACE:
- Rotate date dials to set the year to 1885
- Drag temporal sliders to align chronometer
- Rewire the time machine's circuits
- Gears rotate and steam effects activate when correct

=====================================

=====================================

Theme: Dark Digital Void/Security System
Cipher: Multi-layered (Base64 → Caesar(7) → Atbash)
Encoded Message: (Triple-encrypted message)
Solution: FREEDOM ACHIEVED

HOW TO SOLVE:
1. This is a three-layer encryption that must be decoded in reverse order
2. The message has been encoded with: Atbash → Caesar(7) → Base64
3. To decode: Base64 → Caesar(-7) → Atbash

ENCODING PROCESS (for reference):
1. Original: "FREEDOM ACHIEVED"
2. Apply Atbash: "UVVWLN ZXSRVEVW"
3. Apply Caesar(7): "ICCTOS GKZYLCLK"
4. Apply Base64: "SUNDVFMHR0taWUxDTEs="

DECODING PROCESS:
1. Decode Base64: "SUNDVFMHR0taWUxDTEs=" → "ICCTOS GKZYLCLK"
2. Apply Caesar(-7): "ICCTOS GKZYLCLK" → "UVVWLN ZXSRVEVW"
3. Apply Atbash: "UVVWLN ZXSRVEVW" → "FREEDOM ACHIEVED"

STEP-BY-STEP:
1. First terminal: Decode the Base64 string
2. Second terminal: Apply reverse Caesar cipher (shift -7)
3. Third terminal: Apply Atbash cipher to get final message
4. Each successful decode disables one layer of the firewall

GAME INTERFACE:
